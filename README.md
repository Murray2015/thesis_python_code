# thesis_python_code

This is a repo for python code for my thesis. Currently there is code for a seismic wedge model for a sill intruding at the boundary between two sediments. The code has methods to include guasian random noise, but not coherent noise. There is also the analytical solution for dyke cooling, and a set of scripts for forward and inverse modelling of forced fold / sill thickness data.
